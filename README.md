# bibtex

File containing all our bib items, for LaTeX documents

## Installing

* Clone this repository with ``git clone https://github.com/bbopt/bibtex.git``.

* Set the environment variable ``BIBTEX`` to point to the top of this
  repository. For example if you cloned this repository to ``/some/dir/bibtex``
  then ``export BIBTEX=/some/dir/bibtex``. You can also simply run ``install.sh``.

* Inside your LaTeX documents you can use it with `\bibliography{$BIBTEX/bibliography}`.

* To check if new bib items have been added ``git pull`` inside the folder
  containing ``bibliography.bib``. You can use ``cd $BIBTEX`` to place you directly
  in the appropriate folder.

# Pattern for new items

- Be sure that the item is not already somewhere in the [bibliography.bib](bibliography.bib) file
- Respect the indentation
- Do not add other fields other than the ones in the patterns below
- **NEVER** change a key, even if it is not standard or with the wrong year
